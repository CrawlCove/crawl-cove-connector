# Changelog

## 0.10.2 — 2026-10-02

- **Change log keeps 1,000 entries, and evicts reverted ones first.** The
  log was capped at 200 entries and silently dropped the oldest when full.
  A title and a description on one post are two entries, so one push over
  100 posts overflowed it: the earliest changes of that same push were
  already gone — and unrevertable — when it finished, while both readmes
  promised "any change can be reverted". The cap is now 1,000 (worst case
  at the input limits is about 2MB in a non-autoloaded option that only
  /apply, /revert and the Tools page read), already-reverted entries are
  dropped before any live one, the cap is documented in both readmes, and
  the Tools page says when the log is full. No REST contract change: the
  `/changes` shape is unchanged, it can just return more entries.

## 0.10.1 — 2026-10-02

- **Tools → Crawl Cove now links to the desktop app.** The "Connect the
  Crawl Cove desktop app" steps told a site owner to open Crawl Cove
  without ever saying where to get it — a problem for anyone who finds the
  plugin first (the wordpress.org listing, a search, a colleague's site)
  rather than the crawler first. A new first step links to the download
  page. That link, and the crawlcove.com links in the two readmes, now
  carry plain `utm_*` query parameters so crawlcove.com can count visitors
  who arrived from an installed copy of the plugin. Nothing else changes:
  the plugin still makes no requests of its own, loads nothing remote and
  sends nothing about your site or users — the parameters are visible in
  the link and only travel if you click it. No code path other than the
  admin page's HTML is touched.

## 0.10.0 — 2026-09-27

- **Fix: TranslatePress compatibility.** On a site running TranslatePress
  (the other major free multilingual plugin besides Polylang), every URL
  under a non-default language's prefix — `/fr/some-post/`, `/fr/category/
  news/`, the `/fr/` homepage, all of it — was `ccc_unresolvable`. This
  wasn't a narrow edge case like Polylang's homepage gap; it was every
  translated URL on the whole site. Root cause, verified against
  TranslatePress's own source rather than assumed: it manages its
  language-prefixed URLs (`includes/class-url-converter.php`) with plain
  string manipulation, not a WordPress rewrite rule — there is no
  `add_rewrite_rule()` call anywhere in the plugin. `url_to_postid()` and
  `CCC_Term_Resolver`'s own rewrite-rule matching both work by matching
  against WordPress's *compiled rewrite rules*, so a prefix that isn't one
  of those rules is invisible to them, full stop.
- Architecturally, TranslatePress turned out to be the OPPOSITE problem
  shape from Polylang: Polylang creates genuinely separate content (a real
  post_id per translation) plus a real (if non-public) taxonomy whose
  rewrite rule could collide with CCC's own resolution — see 0.8.1.
  TranslatePress has no separate content or SEO storage per language at
  all; it translates the SAME post's SAME Yoast/Rank Math postmeta at
  render time via its own gettext-style string dictionary, keyed on the
  literal original string text. That makes the fix simpler than Polylang's:
  `CCC_Service::strip_translatepress_language_prefix()` recognises and
  strips a configured non-default language's URL slug (read from
  TranslatePress's own `trp_settings` option — it ships no public `@api`
  equivalent of Polylang's `pll_home_url()`) before any resolution runs, so
  every existing post/term/homepage path handles the stripped URL exactly
  like its default-language counterpart. No REST contract change: `lang`
  stays empty throughout, correctly — there is nothing per-language here
  for it to mean.
- Verified end-to-end against a real WordPress + Yoast + TranslatePress
  install, not source-reading alone (`tests/integration/
  translatepress-checks.sh`, 9/9): a post URL and its `/fr/`-prefixed
  counterpart resolve to the same post_id; the homepage and its `/fr/`
  counterpart both resolve to `HOME_ID`; a CCC title write is read back
  identically from either URL. Confirmed the harness genuinely catches the
  regression by reverting the fix locally first (5/9 failed, as predicted).
- One consequence documented, not fixed, because it isn't a CCC bug: since
  TranslatePress's translation lookup is keyed on the literal original
  string, ANY edit to that string — from CCC or from a site owner's own
  hand-edit in Yoast's metabox, no difference — orphans whatever
  translation already existed until a human re-translates it in
  TranslatePress's own editor. Noted in SECURITY-NOTES.md so it isn't
  rediscovered as "a bug" later.
- Security: the `lang` field shipped in 0.9.0 was never added to
  `security-checks.sh`'s type/injection/unicode/null-byte/oversized-string
  fuzzing matrix every other field gets. Added 12 checks to
  `polylang-yoast-home-checks.sh` (the one harness with Polylang+Yoast
  live) — no bug found, `is_string()` + a strict `in_array()` whitelist
  already rejected everything; now a permanent regression check.

- Packaging (30 Sept, before this version was tagged): `bin/build-zip.sh`
  builds the installable `crawl-cove-connector.zip` from the same
  production file set `tests/integration/plugin-check.sh` checks (one
  exclude list now, shared), verifies the archive unpacks under
  `crawl-cove-connector/` with no tests/vendor inside, and refuses to build
  if the plugin header, `CCC_VERSION`, readme `Stable tag` and this
  changelog disagree. A tag push (`v*`) now creates the GitHub Release with
  that zip attached (`.github/workflows/release.yml`). Installation step 1
  in readme.txt/README.md names the download; the "a few hundred lines"
  size claim is gone (the plugin is about two thousand lines of PHP now).

## 0.9.0 — 2026-09-26

- Real per-language "your latest posts" homepage title/description support
  for multilingual sites, closing the feature gap 0.8.1's safety fix
  deliberately left open (see BACKLOG.md). `/resolve` now reports a
  non-default Polylang language's homepage URL (e.g. `/fr/` under
  directory URL mode) as `post_id: 0` with a new `lang: "fr"` field,
  instead of `ccc_unresolvable`; send that same `lang` back on `/apply`/
  `/revert` to push a fix to it. Fully additive — omitting `lang` (or
  sending the site's own default language code, which is treated
  identically) targets the plain/default-language homepage exactly as the
  existing `post_id: 0` contract always has.
- **Yoast SEO only.** Verified against Polylang's own source (not
  guessed): its `src/integrations/` directory ships a dedicated
  compatibility module *only* for Yoast (`wpseo/wpseo.php`, registering
  `title-home-wpseo`/`metadesc-home-wpseo` with Polylang's own
  string-translation system, `PLL_Translate_Option` → `PLL_MO`) — there is
  no equivalent module for Rank Math, SEOPress or AIOSEO, because none of
  them has a per-language slot to write into at all: each one's homepage
  title/description is one value shared across every language, full stop.
  A `lang`-qualified change sent to any of those three now returns
  `ccc_language_unsupported` — reported, not silently applied as an
  unwanted site-wide change.
- The write itself uses the exact mechanism Polylang's own admin "Strings
  translation" screen uses to save a translation (`PLL_MO::
  import_from_db()`/`add_entry()`/`export_to_db()`) — not a documented
  `@api` function (there isn't one for writing), but the plugin's one real
  internal implementation of "set this string's translation for language
  X", the same one `PLL_Translate_Option` itself relies on for the
  default-language save path already shipped in 0.4.0. Verified end-to-end
  against a real Yoast + Polylang install, across separate HTTP requests
  (write via one REST call, read back via a later one): a French-only
  write leaves the English original, and any OTHER language's own
  translation, untouched; reverting restores Yoast's real fallback
  behaviour (an untranslated language falls back to the default-language
  value, exactly like real gettext, never to blank); a subsequent
  default-language title change correctly reattaches the existing French
  translation to the new original string (Polylang's own behaviour,
  unchanged by this feature). New `tests/integration/
  polylang-yoast-home-checks.sh` (13/13); `tests/integration/
  polylang-checks.sh` updated (an adapter-independent `/resolve` now
  reports `lang` for ANY adapter, with `editable` correctly gating the
  ones that can't act on it). 13 new unit tests (99 total), full gate
  green.

## 0.8.1 — 2026-09-26

- Security/correctness fix: `CCC_Term_Resolver::resolve_pretty_permalink()`
  matched a URL against `$wp_rewrite`'s compiled rules and accepted ANY
  resulting taxonomy-archive query (`is_tax`/`is_category`/`is_tag`), with
  no filter on whether that taxonomy was actually public — unlike its
  sibling `resolve_plain_query_vars()`, which only ever iterates
  `get_taxonomies(['public' => true])`. Found and verified against a real
  Polylang install (not guessed): Polylang registers its own internal
  "language" taxonomy as `public => false` / `publicly_queryable => true`
  (so its language-switcher rewrite rule for the `lang` query var still
  works), and that rule matches a bare `/fr/` — exactly what a French
  "your latest posts" homepage URL looks like under Polylang's default
  directory URL mode. Before this fix, resolving `/fr/` silently returned
  Polylang's own "French" language TERM instead of the homepage or
  `ccc_unresolvable` — CCC would report a title/description fix as
  successfully applied, write it into the SEO plugin's term meta for that
  internal language term, and the real French homepage's rendered title
  would never change: a silent no-op reported as a success. Fixed in two
  places — `resolve_pretty_permalink()` (URL discovery) and
  `CCC_Service::validate_change()` (a direct `{"post_id": -N}` apply/revert
  call must be held to the same rule, not just discovery via URL) — both
  now require `get_taxonomy($term->taxonomy)->public` before accepting a
  term as a valid target. New `tests/integration/polylang-checks.sh`
  (standalone, like woocommerce/multisite-checks.sh) pins the fix against
  a real Polylang install with directory-mode URLs and proves no
  regression on ordinary translated content or language-prefixed archives
  of REAL (public) taxonomies. +1 unit test (86 total). Scope note: this
  fixes the safety bug (never misresolve to internal plumbing); it does
  not add real per-language homepage/archive targeting for Polylang —
  Rank Math itself has no Polylang integration, so its homepage title stays
  one shared value across every language regardless of CCC. A
  non-default-language "your latest posts" homepage is `ccc_unresolvable`,
  not mis-resolved.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-09-26

- Fix: a homepage ("your latest posts" mode) or taxonomy-archive apply/
  revert never signalled a page-caching plugin that the page had changed.
  Both targets write through `update_option()`/term meta directly — no
  post row exists for `wp_update_post()` to re-save, so `clean_post_cache`
  (the action a real post's apply already fires, and the one caching
  plugins hook) never ran. Verified against WP Super Cache's real source
  (`wp-cache-phase2.php`): `wp_cache_post_edit()`/`wp_cache_post_change()`
  both bail immediately on `$post_id === 0` and are registered only on
  `clean_post_cache`, never on any term-edit hook — so a WP Super Cache
  site kept serving the old cached homepage/archive HTML indefinitely
  after a desktop-app push. `CCC_Service::invalidate_caches_for()` now
  runs a best-effort full-site purge for WP Super Cache, W3 Total Cache and
  WP Rocket (via their own public functions, guarded by `function_exists()`)
  plus WP Fastest Cache's and LiteSpeed Cache's own documented
  `wpfc_clear_all_cache`/`litespeed_purge_all` action hooks, and always
  fires a new plugin-agnostic `ccc_after_uncached_write` action for
  anything else.
- Fix: `CCC_Change_Log::revert()` never called `wp_update_post()` at all,
  for ANY target — not even an ordinary post. A reverted post's Yoast
  indexable went stale and no caching plugin's `clean_post_cache` hook
  fired, the exact gap `apply()` already closed for a fresh write. Revert
  now runs through the same `CCC_Service::invalidate_caches_for()` path
  apply() uses, for every target type.
- New `tests/integration/caching-checks.sh`: a real WordPress + real Rank
  Math harness with an mu-plugin probe that logs `clean_post_cache`
  firings and WP Super Cache's own `wp_cache_clear_cache()` (confirmed
  against its real source rather than guessed), plus LiteSpeed's
  `litespeed_purge_all` and the new `ccc_after_uncached_write` action.
  12/12 checks green with the fix; confirmed the harness actually catches
  the bug by reverting the fix locally first — 10/12 failed as predicted
  (only the pre-existing "apply on a real post" path passed).
- 85 unit tests (+1), full gate green (phpcs, phpcompat, 4-adapter
  integration matrix, Plugin Check) — see SECURITY-NOTES.md for the full
  writeup.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-09-24

- SEOPress taxonomy term title/description support, extending 0.6.0's
  per-term target (Yoast, Rank Math) to a third adapter. Verified against
  real SEOPress source: unlike Yoast's shared-option storage, per-term SEO
  data is plain term meta under the *exact same key names* as its
  post-level fields (`_seopress_titles_title`/`_seopress_titles_desc`),
  confirmed at `src/Services/Metas/Title/Specifications/
  TaxonomySpecification.php` (read) and `inc/admin/metaboxes/
  admin-term-metaboxes.php` (write, plain `update_term_meta()`/
  `delete_term_meta()`) — no shared-array read-modify-write risk, same
  simple pattern as Rank Math's term storage, so both now share one code
  path in `CCC_Adapter`.
- AIOSEO's term unsupported status is now confirmed on the merits, not
  left unresearched: its own source (`app/Common/Main/BulkActions.php`)
  states outright that per-term SEO analysis columns "live on the Pro
  aioseo_terms table" and the free-tier REST term controller's meta-field
  registration is a deliberate no-op ("Term SEO meta requires the Pro Term
  model"). The free plugin this connector supports has no term SEO storage
  to write to at all.
- 84 unit tests (+2), taxonomy integration checks extended to all
  supporting adapters, full gate green, Plugin Check clean.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-09-24

- Taxonomy term title/description support: fix a single category, tag or
  custom-taxonomy archive's title/description without touching any other
  term in that taxonomy (the taxonomy-wide default TEMPLATE was explicitly
  scoped out — see BACKLOG.md — a template fix would let one crawled-URL
  fix silently rewrite every other term's title). New negative post_id
  sentinel (`post_id = -$term_id`) across `/resolve`, `/apply`, `/revert`,
  the same "reuse the existing int slot" trick `HOME_ID` (0) already uses
  for the homepage — no new REST fields, no change-log schema change.
  `CCC_Term_Resolver` (new) resolves a term archive URL two ways: query-var
  matching for "Plain" permalinks (`?cat=N`, `?category_name=slug`,
  `?tag=slug`, and any other public taxonomy's own registered query_var),
  and rewrite-rule matching for pretty permalinks, adapted from WordPress
  core's own `url_to_postid()` (checks `is_tax`/`is_category`/`is_tag`
  instead of `is_singular`). Capability is `edit_term` (WordPress core's own
  meta capability, maps to `manage_categories` for category/post_tag).
  Yoast via `WPSEO_Taxonomy_Meta::get_term_meta()`/`set_values()`; Rank Math
  via real term meta (`rank_math_title`/`rank_math_description`, same key
  names as posts, via core's `get_term_meta()`/`update_term_meta()`).
  SEOPress and AIOSEO report `ccc_term_unsupported` per-item rather than
  guessing at their storage.
- Fix, found by the real-WordPress integration harness rather than unit
  stubs: `url_to_postid()` has its own quirk on a site with a static front
  page — *any* query string at the site root (not just the homepage's own)
  collapses to the front page's post id, because its "is what's left the
  home URL?" check runs before rewrite-rule matching. `?cat=2` was
  resolving to the homepage instead of the category. Fixed by resolving
  query-string term targets BEFORE calling `url_to_postid()`, not after — a
  named taxonomy query var is a far more precise signal than that coarse
  check.
- Fix, also caught by the integration harness: Yoast's own
  `WPSEO_Taxonomy_Meta::set_value()` is not a true single-field patch for
  most fields — writing just a term's title (or just its description) was
  silently resetting the OTHER of the two back to '', and would do the same
  to any other Yoast term setting a site owner had set by hand (focus
  keyword, Open Graph/Twitter overrides, cornerstone flag). Fixed by
  reading the term's full current Yoast settings first and writing them all
  back with only the intended field changed.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-09-23

- SEOPress homepage title/description support, extending 0.4.0's
  `post_id: 0` homepage target to a third adapter. Storage:
  `seopress_titles_option_name` option's `seopress_titles_home_site_title` /
  `seopress_titles_home_site_desc` keys, written through the same
  read-whole-array-then-`update_option()` pattern SEOPress's own setup
  wizard uses (`inc/admin/wizard/admin-wizard.php`). Confirmed safe to clear
  to '': `LatestPostsSpecification::isSatisfyBy()` in SEOPress's own title/
  description generator explicitly stops applying when the value is empty,
  falling through to the next specification rather than rendering blank —
  same safety class as Yoast, no `can_clear_home_title()` exception needed.
- AIOSEO investigated properly this session and confirmed genuinely
  unsupported, not just unresearched: `Meta\Title::getHomePageTitle()` and
  `Meta\Description::getHomePageDescription()` (app/Common/Meta/) fall back,
  for a "your latest posts" site, to
  `searchAppearance.global.siteTitle`/`.metaDescription` — the *same*
  site-wide template that fills the `#site_title`/`#tagline` variables used
  in every other page's title/description template. AIOSEO has no dedicated
  per-homepage field to write to; doing so would silently change title
  generation across the whole site, not just `/`. `ccc_home_unsupported`
  stays correct for AIOSEO, now for a verified reason.
- 61 unit tests (+2), full 4-adapter integration suite (including
  `tests/integration/homepage-checks.sh`) green, Plugin Check clean.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-09-23

- Homepage title/description support for sites with **no static front page**
  (Settings → Reading → "Your latest posts"). Previously only a static front
  page worked, because it's just a normal page and CCC already resolved/wrote
  it like any other post; a "latest posts" homepage has no post to hold an
  override, so Yoast and Rank Math each keep it in their own settings —
  `wpseo_titles` (`title-home-wpseo` / `metadesc-home-wpseo`) and
  `rank-math-options-titles` (`homepage_title` / `homepage_description`)
  respectively, both confirmed against real plugin source and both written
  through the plugin's own safe read-modify-write helper (`WPSEO_Options::
  save_option()` for Yoast; read-whole-array-then-`update_option()` for Rank
  Math), never a bare option overwrite — either would silently wipe every
  other setting sharing that option array.
- New REST target: `/resolve`, `/apply` and `/revert` now accept `post_id: 0`
  meaning "the homepage" (`CCC_Service::HOME_ID`). `/resolve` reports it
  automatically for the site root when there's no static front page.
  Permission is `manage_options`, not `edit_post` (there's no post to check
  `edit_post` against). SEOPress and AIOSEO report `ccc_home_unsupported`
  rather than silently dropping the change; sending `post_id: 0` on a site
  that *does* have a static front page reports `ccc_no_homepage_target`.
- Found and fixed while implementing, before it ever wrote anything wrong:
  (1) a homepage write must never trigger the post-apply `wp_update_post()`
  "touch" — `wp_update_post( [ 'ID' => 0 ] )` is WordPress core's signal to
  **insert a new post**, not a no-op, which would have created a stray empty
  post on every homepage change; (2) the initial homepage-URL matcher ignored
  query strings, so a "Plain" permalink post at the site root
  (`/?p=5`) was misidentified as the homepage — fixed by requiring an empty
  query string; (3) Rank Math's homepage title has no template fallback when
  cleared (unlike Yoast's homepage fields and Rank Math's own homepage
  description, which do fall back safely) — verified against real Rank Math
  source, confirmed on a live install, and now refused with
  `ccc_home_title_clear_unsupported` instead of shipping a blank
  browser-tab title to a stranger's site.
- `tests/integration/homepage-checks.sh` (new, run by `run.sh` for every
  adapter): switches a real WordPress site to "your latest posts" mode,
  proves the resolve/apply/revert round-trip against the SEO plugin's own
  stored option (not just CCC's own read-back), the `manage_options`
  capability gate, the Rank Math clear-title guard, and the
  `ccc_home_unsupported` path for SEOPress/AIOSEO. 59 unit tests (was 37,
  +22), full 4-adapter integration suite still green.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-22

- AIOSEO adapter. Structurally different from the other three: AIOSEO 4.x
  stores title/description in a custom `wp_aioseo_posts` table (40+
  columns, several JSON-encoded), not postmeta. Verified against real
  AIOSEO 4.9 source before writing anything: the REST-controller wrapper
  (`PostSeoService`) is explicitly `@internal Not a public extension
  surface`, but `\AIOSEO\Plugin\Common\Models\Post::savePost()` (their own
  internal callers' write path, `@since 4.0.3`, not `@internal`) is
  patch-style — it only touches the keys you pass, filling in every other
  column's default when the row doesn't exist yet. Confirmed empty-string
  correctly falls back to AIOSEO's default title template (their renderer
  uses PHP's `empty()`, true for both `''` and `null`). Added a permanent
  integration-harness regression check
  (`tests/integration/aioseo-checks.sh`) that seeds a post with unrelated
  AIOSEO fields (social titles) via AIOSEO's own API, applies a title/
  description change through CCC's real REST route, and asserts the
  unrelated fields survive untouched — this is the one claim from reading
  the source that needed proving against a real write, not just reading.
- `tests/integration/run.sh` now builds an AIOSEO site too
  (`--adapter=aioseo`); 68/68 checks green (26 route + 42 security), no
  regressions on rankmath/yoast/seopress.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-22

- SEOPress adapter (`_seopress_titles_title` / `_seopress_titles_desc`),
  verified against SEOPress 10.2 source: same postmeta keys its own admin
  metabox saves to, empty value deletes the meta key exactly like Yoast and
  Rank Math. Detection via `SEOPRESS_VERSION`.
- `CCC_Adapter::label()` for the admin page's plugin-name display (was an
  inline Yoast/Rank Math ternary, now scales to any adapter).
- wordpress.org submission pack verified: `wp plugin check` via a new
  `tests/integration/plugin-check.sh` (production file set only — the
  integration harness's whole-repo symlink makes Plugin Check hang on
  vendor/'s dev tooling) — 0 errors, 0 warnings.
- Investigated AIOSEO (All in One SEO) for a third adapter: its title/
  description live in a custom `wp_aioseo_posts` table with 40+ JSON-encoded
  columns, and the only in-plugin write path is explicitly marked
  `@internal Not a public extension surface`. Needs its own integration
  harness before shipping, not a quick postmeta-style addition — left for a
  dedicated session (see BACKLOG.md).

## 0.1.1 — 2026-09-22

- Fix: `resolve_url()` now verifies `get_post()` before returning a resolved
  id — WordPress core's `url_to_postid()` pattern-matches `?p=N` out of the
  query string and returns `N` even when no such post exists, so `/resolve`
  was reporting a phantom post as successfully resolved.
- Real-WordPress integration test harness (`tests/integration/`): SQLite
  drop-in, Rank Math and Yoast, all five REST routes end-to-end.
- Security pass: auth sweep, subscriber/author/editor capability matrix,
  `/apply` + `/resolve` payload fuzzing. No vulnerabilities found
  (`SECURITY-NOTES.md`).
- PHPCS clean against WordPress-Extra + WordPress-Docs (`phpcs.xml.dist`).
- POT file for translators (`languages/crawl-cove-connector.pot`).
- wordpress.org submission pack: icon/banner/screenshot assets
  (`wordpress-org/`).

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-21

First version.

- Yoast SEO and Rank Math adapters (writes their native title/description post meta; empty string removes the override).
- REST API under `crawlcove/v1`: `/status`, `/resolve`, `/apply` (with `dry_run`), `/changes`, `/revert`.
- Authentication via WordPress core Application Passwords; `edit_posts` required on every route, `edit_post` re-checked per post.
- Change log (capped at 200 entries) with previous values; revert from the API or from Tools → Crawl Cove.
- Touched posts are re-saved after apply so Yoast's indexables pick the change up immediately (filter `ccc_touch_post_after_apply` to disable).
- Unit tests for the adapter, change log and service layers.
