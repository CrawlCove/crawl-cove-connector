# Security pass — 22 Sept 2026

Run against a real WordPress install (SQLite drop-in, no MySQL), both Rank
Math and Yoast SEO, over live HTTP with Application Password auth. Reproduce
with `tests/integration/run.sh --adapter=rankmath|yoast` — it runs
`checks.sh` (route behaviour, 22 checks) then `security-checks.sh` (this
pass, 42 checks). Both adapters: 64/64 green.

## Scope

- Every route (`status`, `resolve`, `apply`, `changes`, `revert`) confirmed
  to require authentication — no route reachable without valid Application
  Password credentials, and a wrong password is rejected too.
- Full capability matrix: subscriber (no `edit_posts`) blocked at all five
  routes with 403; author (`edit_posts`, not `edit_others_posts`) can act on
  their own posts but is `ccc_forbidden` on another user's post; editor
  (`edit_others_posts`) can act on any post — all matching WordPress core's
  own capability model, nothing bespoke in the plugin to get wrong.
- `/apply` and `/resolve` fuzzed: wrong types (string/null/object/array where
  a string or array is expected), nested objects, non-numeric `post_id`,
  10k-character strings, exact length-cap boundaries (512/1024/50/100),
  `<script>` tags, a SQL-injection-shaped string, an embedded null byte, and
  deliberately truncated/malformed JSON. Every case returns a clean 4xx or a
  per-item `ok:false` — no PHP warning, stack trace, or file path ever
  appears in a response body.
- `/revert`: missing/non-numeric/negative/nonexistent `change_id` all handled
  without a crash (400 or 404, never 500).

## Findings

1. **Fixed in code** (see `includes/class-ccc-service.php`): WordPress
   core's `url_to_postid()` pattern-matches `?p=N` straight out of a URL's
   query string and returns `N` even when no such post exists. `resolve_url()`
   trusted that blindly, so a stale or guessed numeric URL was reported as a
   successfully resolved (but blank, uneditable) post instead of "not found".
   Now verifies `get_post()` before returning; covered by a new unit test in
   `tests/ServiceTest.php` plus the integration check
   "resolve: phantom numeric id (url_to_postid quirk) is unresolvable".

2. **Observed, no code change needed**: WordPress's REST argument layer does
   not 400 a scalar against a route arg declared `type => 'array'` — it
   silently `(array)`-casts it to a one-element array instead of rejecting
   the request. Both `/resolve`'s `urls` and `/apply`'s `changes` rely on
   this only as a first line of defense; the plugin's own `is_array()` /
   per-item validation in `CCC_Service` is what actually catches the
   malformed shape, and it does so safely in every case tested. Worth
   knowing if either route's args are ever refactored: don't assume the REST
   layer enforces the declared `type` for you.

3. **Confirmed safe, not a finding**: `sanitize_text_field()` (used on every
   title/description value) strips `<script>` and other tags before
   storage, and the admin page (`admin/class-ccc-admin.php`) escapes every
   logged value with `esc_html()` on output — defense in depth on both ends,
   no stored-XSS path found.

4. **Confirmed safe, not a finding**: capability checks (`current_user_can`)
   correctly deny `edit_post` for a non-existent post id, so even the
   url_to_postid quirk in (1) could never have led to an unauthorized write
   — `/apply` with a phantom post id returned `ccc_forbidden`, not a crash or
   a write. (1) was a read-side correctness bug in `/resolve`'s response,
   not a write-side authorization gap.

## Addendum — 24 Sept 2026 (taxonomy term support, v0.6.0)

Same harness, extended with `tests/integration/taxonomy-checks.sh` (16
checks) covering the new negative-`post_id` term target across all four
adapters, plain and pretty permalinks, and the `edit_term`/`manage_categories`
capability boundary (author blocked, editor allowed — WordPress core's own
model again, nothing bespoke). Two more real-WordPress-only findings, same
class as finding 1 above (a core quirk / a plugin helper's own behaviour
trusted too literally, not a vulnerability in this plugin's own code):

5. **Fixed in code**: on a site with a static front page, `url_to_postid()`
   collapses *any* query string at the site root (not just the homepage's
   own) to the front page's post id — `?cat=2` was resolving to the
   homepage, not the category. `resolve_url()` now resolves query-string
   term targets (`CCC_Term_Resolver::resolve_plain_query_vars()`) *before*
   calling `url_to_postid()`, not after.
6. **Fixed in code**: Yoast's own `WPSEO_Taxonomy_Meta::set_value()` is not
   a true single-field patch — writing just a term's title (or just its
   description) was silently resetting the other back to `''`, and would do
   the same to any other Yoast term setting a site owner had set by hand
   (focus keyword, Open Graph/Twitter overrides, cornerstone flag). Not an
   auth/injection issue, but a real silent-data-loss bug a wordpress.org
   reviewer or a site owner could reasonably treat as a security-adjacent
   correctness defect. Fixed by reading the term's full current settings
   first (`get_term_meta()` with no `$meta` arg) and writing them all back
   with only the intended field changed.

## Addendum — 26 Sept 2026 (WooCommerce + Multisite capability verification)

Two new standalone harnesses (`tests/integration/woocommerce-checks.sh`,
`tests/integration/multisite-checks.sh`), same "prove it against a real
install, don't trust the code read" discipline as the addenda above. No
vulnerabilities found; one capability-model behavior worth recording here
because it's exactly the kind of thing a site owner could mistake for a
CCC bug (or a security hole in the other direction — an Editor who thinks
they can't touch products, when actually they simply lack the capability
core already withholds):

7. **Not a CCC issue, confirmed on the merits**: WooCommerce grants
   `edit_products`/`edit_product_terms` (and related capabilities) ONLY to
   the Shop Manager and Administrator roles — verified against
   `WC_Install::create_roles()` and `WC_Post_Types::register_taxonomies()`
   source, not assumed. CCC's `edit_post`/`edit_term` capability checks defer
   entirely to WordPress core's meta-capability system, so an Editor who can
   push fixes to ordinary posts/pages correctly gets `ccc_forbidden` on a
   WooCommerce product or product_cat term. This is WooCommerce's own
   authorization model working as intended, not a gap in CCC. Documented in
   README.md.
8. **Multisite scoping confirmed, not assumed**: activating CCC + Rank Math
   on one subsite of a network and hitting the network root's REST API
   returns a genuine `rest_no_route` 404 (route doesn't exist there at all),
   not a `ccc_forbidden`/`rest_forbidden` — confirming `register_rest_route()`
   is correctly per-site (fires on each site's own `rest_api_init`) with no
   network-wide leakage, and that a write via the subsite's REST endpoint
   lands in that subsite's own postmeta table, never the network's shared
   tables.

## Addendum — 26 Sept 2026 (caching-plugin interaction — a real bug, now fixed)

Investigated on the hypothesis that a caching plugin's own per-page purge
hook might not fire for every CCC write path — not a security issue, but a
correctness one with the same "silent, invisible failure" shape worth this
file's discipline. Confirmed real, not assumed: downloaded WP Super Cache's
actual current-stable source from wordpress.org and read its cache-purge
functions directly (`wp-cache-phase2.php`) rather than guessing at its
behavior.

9. **Real bug, now fixed**: `wp_cache_post_edit()`/`wp_cache_post_change()`
   — WP Super Cache's own functions, hooked to core's `clean_post_cache`
   action — both `return` immediately when `$post_id === 0`, and neither is
   registered on any term-edit action at all. CCC's homepage (`post_id 0`)
   and taxonomy-archive (negative term-id sentinel) writes went through
   `update_option()`/term meta directly, with no `wp_update_post()` call to
   fire `clean_post_cache` in the first place — so a site running WP Super
   Cache (or any similarly-built caching plugin) kept serving a stale
   cached homepage or category/tag archive page after a desktop-app push,
   for as long as that page's cache lived. `CCC_Service::invalidate_caches_for()`
   now runs a best-effort full-site purge (WP Super Cache, W3 Total Cache,
   WP Rocket via `function_exists()`-guarded calls to their own public
   functions, plus WP Fastest Cache's and LiteSpeed Cache's own documented
   action hooks — `wpfc_clear_all_cache`/`litespeed_purge_all`, neither of
   which is a callable function despite the naming convention suggesting
   otherwise; confirmed against WP Fastest Cache's real downloaded source,
   which registers it with `add_action()`, not `function_exists()`-checkable
   at all) for these two target types, and always fires a new
   `ccc_after_uncached_write` action for anything not listed. Initially
   wrote `wpfc_clear_all_cache` as a `function_exists()` guard by pattern-
   matching the others without checking its real source first — caught and
   fixed before commit by downloading WP Fastest Cache and grepping it,
   the same discipline as the rest of this file.
10. **Second real bug found investigating the first**: `CCC_Change_Log::
    revert()` never called `wp_update_post()` at all, for ANY target —
    including an ordinary post. A reverted post's Yoast indexable went
    stale and no caching plugin learned the page changed, the exact defect
    class `apply()` already had a fix for (re-saving the post) that
    `revert()` simply never inherited. Both fixes share one code path now
    (`CCC_Service::invalidate_caches_for()`, called from both `apply()` and
    `revert()`), so they can't drift apart again silently.

Verified against a real WordPress + real Rank Math install, not just unit
stubs: `tests/integration/caching-checks.sh` uses an mu-plugin probe that
logs real firings of `clean_post_cache` and a stand-in for WP Super Cache's
own `wp_cache_clear_cache()` (name and signature taken from its real
source, not guessed). Confirmed the harness genuinely catches the bug, not
just exercises the happy path: reverted the fix locally and re-ran it first
— 10 of 12 checks failed exactly as predicted, then re-ran with the fix
restored for a clean 12/12.

## Addendum — 26 Sept 2026 (Gutenberg/block-editor concurrent-edit check — investigated, no bug)

Tested a specific hypothesis the previous session's handoff flagged as
worth checking: does having a post open in the block editor risk a stale
sidebar value silently overwriting a CCC push? Real difference found
between adapters first, via a live Gutenberg session (Playwright,
`wp.data.select('core/editor').getCurrentPost().meta`): **Yoast SEO
registers `_yoast_wpseo_title`/`_yoast_wpseo_metadesc` — the exact same
postmeta keys CCC itself writes — as Gutenberg REST meta fields, visible
in the editor's own state. Rank Math does not** (its SEO panel doesn't
appear in `post.meta` at all, so this class of risk doesn't apply to it).

That raised a real question for Yoast: if an editor tab loads the OLD
title into its meta store, CCC pushes a NEW title via REST while that tab
sits open, and the user then saves the post for an unrelated reason (e.g.
fixing a typo in the body) — does Gutenberg's `savePost()` resend its
stale copy of `meta` and clobber CCC's fresh write? **Tested against a
real WordPress + real Yoast install, not assumed: no.** Editing post
content (never touching the Yoast SEO panel) and calling
`wp.data.dispatch('core/editor').savePost()` produced a PUT that changed
`post_content` but left `_yoast_wpseo_title` in the database exactly as
CCC had just set it — confirmed by reading the postmeta directly after
the save completed, not just by reading network traffic. Gutenberg only
includes an attribute (including the whole `meta` object) in its save
diff when that attribute was explicitly dispatched via `editPost()` in
that browser session; merely having loaded a value into the store isn't
enough. The only real collision left is the ordinary case of two edits to
the SAME field in the same window — no different from any two concurrent
editors of one WordPress field, not a CCC-specific bug, and not pursued
further. No code change needed.

## Addendum — 26 Sept 2026 (multilingual-plugin URL resolution — a real bug, now fixed, v0.8.1)

Investigated Polylang (the largest free WordPress multilingual plugin,
700,000+ installs) as an untested compatibility surface, following the same
"prove it against a real install, don't trust a code read" discipline as the
WooCommerce/multisite passes. Downloaded Polylang's real current-stable
source from wordpress.org rather than guessing at its internals.

11. **Real bug, now fixed**: `CCC_Term_Resolver::resolve_pretty_permalink()`
    accepted ANY rewrite-rule match that resolved to a taxonomy-archive
    query (`is_tax`/`is_category`/`is_tag`), with no check on whether that
    taxonomy was actually `public` — unlike its own sibling method,
    `resolve_plain_query_vars()`, which only ever iterates
    `get_taxonomies(['public' => true])`. Confirmed against Polylang's real
    source (`src/translated-post.php`): Polylang registers its own internal
    "language" taxonomy (used for its language switcher) as
    `public => false` / `publicly_queryable => true` / `query_var => 'lang'`
    — publicly queryable so its own rewrite rule works, but explicitly not
    public because it isn't real content. Under Polylang's default
    directory URL mode (default language at the root, others under `/xx/`),
    that rewrite rule matches a bare `/fr/` — exactly the shape of a French
    "your latest posts" homepage URL. Verified live against a real
    WordPress + real Polylang + real Rank Math install: resolving `/fr/`
    returned Polylang's own "French" language TERM (a negative-sentinel
    target CCC treats as fully editable) instead of the homepage or
    `ccc_unresolvable`. Applying a title through it reported `ok: true` and
    genuinely wrote into Rank Math's term meta for that internal term —
    **the desktop app would tell a user their homepage fix succeeded, and
    the real page would never change.** Silent-failure-reported-as-success
    is the worst class of bug for a plugin whose whole premise is "crawl,
    fix, push live, verify."
12. **Same gap, second entry point**: `CCC_Service::validate_change()`
    accepted any existing term id for a negative `post_id`, with no
    publicness check either — so even after fixing URL resolution, a
    caller passing `{"post_id": -5}` directly (bypassing `/resolve`
    entirely) could still reach the same internal term. Both entry points
    now require `get_taxonomy($term->taxonomy)->public` before accepting a
    term as a valid target, closing the gap at both the discovery and the
    write layer, not just one.

Verified against a real WordPress + real Rank Math + real Polylang install,
not unit stubs alone: `tests/integration/polylang-checks.sh` (new,
standalone, like woocommerce/multisite-checks.sh) proves the fix directly
(a French homepage URL and a direct term-id apply attempt both now fail
cleanly) and proves no regression on the things that must keep working —
ordinary translated posts stay genuinely isolated per language, and a real
(public) category taxonomy's own language-prefixed archive URL
(`/fr/category/news/`) still resolves correctly. Full 4-adapter matrix
(`run.sh`) plus woocommerce/multisite/caching-checks.sh and plugin-check.sh
all re-verified clean after the fix; +1 unit test (86 total).

Deliberately out of scope: this fixes the safety bug (never misresolve to
internal plumbing), not real per-language homepage/archive SEO targeting for
multilingual sites. Rank Math itself has no Polylang integration at all
(confirmed: only Yoast has a dedicated compat layer in Polylang's own
source, wrapping its homepage title/description strings for Polylang's own
translation system) — its homepage title stays one shared value across
every language regardless of anything CCC does. A non-default-language
"your latest posts" homepage is honestly `ccc_unresolvable` for now, not
silently wrong. Real multilingual-aware homepage targeting would be a
larger, separate feature — noted in BACKLOG.md, not rushed into this fix.

## Addendum — 26 Sept 2026 (Yoast homepage title + Polylang string translation — investigated, no bug)

Follow-up question raised by the addendum above: on a Yoast + Polylang site,
does pushing a CCC homepage (`post_id: 0`) title/description write through
`WPSEO_Options::save_option()` corrupt or silently overwrite a non-default
language's already-translated homepage title? Polylang has a real,
dedicated compat layer for exactly this (`src/integrations/wpseo/wpseo.php`
registers `wpseo_titles`'s `title-home-wpseo`/`metadesc-home-wpseo` for its
own string-translation system via `PLL_Translate_Option`), so this wasn't
assumed safe just because the Rank Math case (no Polylang integration at
all) is.

Tested against a real WordPress + real Yoast + real Polylang install, not
just a read of `PLL_Translate_Option`'s source: configured an English
homepage title/description via Yoast directly, registered a French
translation for both strings the same way Polylang's own Strings
Translation admin screen would (via `PLL_MO::add_entry()`/`export_to_db()`
against the French language term's `_pll_strings_translations` term meta),
then pushed a NEW English title/description through CCC's real `/apply`
REST route (admin user, `manage_options`, the actual capability gate for
`HOME_ID`). Result: **no corruption.** The raw `wpseo_titles` option now
holds the new English strings (correct — CCC's write). Polylang's own
`pre_update_option_wpseo_titles`/`update_option_wpseo_titles` filters (the
"step 1 filter out the update, step 2 reattach the old translation to the
new original string" mechanism `PLL_Translate_Option::pre_update_option()`/
`update_option()` implement) fired exactly as designed: the French term's
`_pll_strings_translations` term meta still maps to the *same* French
translation strings, now re-keyed to the new English original rather than
lost. A site owner's French Yoast homepage title survives a CCC push to the
English one untouched — safe by construction, not by luck: this is
literally the scenario `PLL_Translate_Option` exists to handle (any
plugin/admin action that updates the option's raw value), CCC isn't doing
anything unusual to it. No code change needed.

Scope note, unchanged from the addendum above: this confirms CCC pushing to
the DEFAULT language's homepage is safe on a Yoast+Polylang site — it does
not mean a non-default language's homepage is independently *reachable* by
CCC. `resolve_url()` still can't discover `/fr/` as a target at all (fixed
in v0.8.1 to fail cleanly as `ccc_unresolvable` rather than misresolve); a
real French-homepage-specific fix would need Polylang-aware URL resolution
that doesn't exist yet, tracked as an open BACKLOG.md item, not a safety
concern.

## Addendum — 26 Sept 2026 (real per-language homepage support, v0.9.0 — new feature, security-reviewed)

The addendum above confirmed the DEFAULT language's homepage write was safe
on a Yoast+Polylang site, but left the actual feature gap open: a
non-default language's own homepage (`/fr/`) was `ccc_unresolvable`, not a
target CCC could reach. This session closed that gap for Yoast (the only
adapter with real per-language homepage storage — confirmed against
Polylang's own source: `src/integrations/` has a dedicated compat module
only for Yoast, none for Rank Math/SEOPress/AIOSEO).

**New capability surface, security-relevant bits:**

- New optional `lang` field on `/apply`/`/revert` change items. Validated
  before anything is written: must be a string, must name one of the
  site's own currently-active Polylang languages
  (`in_array($lang, pll_languages_list(), true)` — not a bare "is this a
  plausible-looking language code" regex), and is only accepted alongside
  `post_id: 0` (`ccc_language_requires_home` otherwise) — so this can't be
  smuggled onto an ordinary post/term write to do anything unexpected
  there.
- Capability check is unchanged: `manage_options`, gated exactly like the
  existing default-language homepage target, checked BEFORE the
  language-specific adapter-support gate — a user who can't manage the
  homepage at all can't discover adapter support by probing `lang` values
  either (same ordering `can_edit_target()` already enforced).
- The write (`PLL_MO::import_from_db()`/`add_entry()`/`export_to_db()`)
  targets a `PLL_Language` object obtained via `PLL()->model->get_language(
  $lang)`, itself only reachable after the `in_array()` active-language
  check above passes — an attacker-controlled `lang` string is never
  passed to Polylang's API directly without that allowlist check first
  (fuzzing-relevant: unicode/oversized/null-byte `lang` strings all fail
  the `in_array()` check the same as any other unrecognised code, same
  class of guard `security-checks.sh` already exercises for `post_id`).
- `resolve_url()`'s new Polylang-language-home matching
  (`resolve_polylang_home_language()`) runs LAST, only after every existing
  post/term resolution path has already missed — it cannot shadow or
  pre-empt a real post/term match, only fill the specific gap that used to
  fall through to `ccc_unresolvable`.
- Resolution itself (`/resolve`) is deliberately adapter-independent — it
  reports `lang` for a matched URL regardless of which SEO plugin is
  active, with `editable: false` for one that can't act on it. This is not
  an information leak beyond what `/resolve` already exposes for every
  other target (current title/description text, which SEO plugin is
  active): whether a site runs Polylang, and what its active language
  codes are, is already public information any visitor can see from the
  site's own rendered `<html lang>` attribute and URL structure.
- Verified this session (not assumed) that a `lang`-qualified write cannot
  cross into another language's translation or the default-language
  value: `tests/integration/polylang-yoast-home-checks.sh` proves a French
  write leaves the raw (default-language) `wpseo_titles` option
  byte-for-byte untouched, and that reverting a French write restores
  Yoast's real fallback rendering (the default-language value, per real
  gettext semantics — confirmed against a real install this is what an
  untranslated string actually renders as, not a guess) rather than
  leaving anything blank or duplicated across languages.

No new external requests, no new stored PII, no change to the
authentication model. Full write-up (design rationale, REST contract,
adapter-support matrix) in README.md's "Multilingual sites" section and
CHANGELOG.md's 0.9.0 entry.

## Not covered here (separate backlog items)

- PHPCS / WordPress-Coding-Standards pass.
- CSRF: not applicable — the REST API here is authenticated by Application
  Passwords (Basic Auth), which WordPress core exempts from the cookie-nonce
  CSRF check by design (same model core itself uses for the REST API).
- Rate limiting / brute-force protection on Application Password auth: this
  plugin doesn't implement its own; it relies on whatever the host/core
  provides. Documented in `readme.txt`'s FAQ (26 Sept 2026) rather than left
  as an undocumented gap for a wordpress.org reviewer to ask about.
