#
# Compares the SEO plugin zips cached under tests/integration/.cache/ (used
# by run.sh's real-WordPress integration harness) against the CURRENT stable
# version each plugin has on wordpress.org right now, and flags drift.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: run.sh refuses to auto-download — it errors if a cache
# file is missing, and silently reuses whatever's already there otherwise.
# That's correct for repeatable, offline-friendly test runs, but it means
# the cache can go stale with nothing ever saying so: on 26 Sept 2026 the
# cached AIOSEO build was still 5.0.1.1 four days after wordpress.org shipped
# 5.0.2, and every integration run in between was quietly testing against a
# build nobody would actually be running in production anymore. Found by
# accident that session, not by any check — this script makes it a check.
#
# This is a manual pre-release / periodic sanity script, like plugin-check.sh
# — NOT wired into composer test or CI, because it needs network access and
# an offline/CI run should stay deterministic. Run it yourself every so often
# (e.g. at the top of a wp session) and re-run tests/integration/run.sh for
# any adapter it flags as stale.
#
# Usage: tests/integration/check-versions.sh
